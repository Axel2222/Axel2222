# Hey there 👋 I'm Svetlin (aka Axel)

### 🚀 FiveM Developer | TeamsGG Crew

I'm a **FiveM developer** with years of experience bringing immersive roleplay systems to life.  
Currently part of the [TeamsGG](https://teamsgg.dev) dev team, where we push the limits of GTA V roleplay servers.

### 🛠️ What I Work With
- **Core:** Lua, React  
- **Also played with:** PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, CSS, Laravel, and more  

I enjoy mixing back-end logic with front-end flavor — whether it’s optimizing performance in Lua or building slick UIs in React.
